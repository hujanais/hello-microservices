### Tech stack
One of the many benefits of microservices is that you can use any programming language of your choice and you can mix and match languages and database technologies.  For example, you can use a NodeJS-Express authentication service, a Java SpringBoot product service, and an Angular front end.

For my demo, I have decided to use the following tech stack.  ReactJS and .NET Core WebAPI were new for me.

 - Database - MongoDB
 - WebServices - .NET Core 6.0
 - Front-End - ReactJS
 - Deployment target - Raspberry PI
 - Docker
 - Nginx
